# Hello There!

I'm **Favian**, a student currently studying in `Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)`, Singapore. I code sometimes and am active in my school's robotics club, `8059 BLANK.`.

I've learnt to code in `Python` and `Swift`, and a little of `Java`, but now I'm diving into `JavaScript` and `Dart` to develop web applications with React JS and Flutter.
